about=This algorithm aims at creating single years of age for any level of administrative boundaries or any other polygon layer, based on clustered 5-year age group raster files, by applying Sprague multipliers. It also allows the user to reconstruct the different school age groups for a particular country, regardless of whether the system divides lower and upper secondary or not.
